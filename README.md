## About Me

I am an **IT Operations Leader** and **incoming DBA Candidate** bridging the gap between technical execution and business strategy. My career has evolved from avionics systems in the USAF to managing corporate IT infrastructure and automating GRC workflows.

I don't just solve IT problems; I build the systems, teams, and automation that prevent them from happening.

**Current Focus:**
* **DBA Candidate:** Researching GRC Workflow Automation at South College
* **Compliance:** NIST 800-171 / CMMC
* **Automation:** Python & PowerShell for Operational Efficiency
